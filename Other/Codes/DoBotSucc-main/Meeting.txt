Information from Meeting with Gavin 21/04/2022

Simulation:
Robot will pick up lego blocks being fed on a conveyor belt platform and place them in respected containers. User has the option
through GUI to choose a certain type of block (e.g. red only) in which DoBot robot will ignore other conditions (other coloured blocks) and focus on
goal.

Physical:
Robot will be using RGB depth Real sense camera to configure DoBot Robot to pick up blocks (lego)
and place them into allocated containers.

Additional Notes:
- must use rmic to stack lego blocks at the end
-visual servoing, constantly re computing each frame velocity
-collision avoidance. add something big to convayer, detect when collided with robot; stop system
